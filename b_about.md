## Hi!
First of all, thanks for considering your time worthy for my introduction! I am Akash Kumar Dutta, graduate from IIT Kanpur.  

## Why this site?
Well, I didn't want to write about myself in the first place. I am inquisitive about core development and cloud infrastructures, but also scrubbing the basics of ISA's, Operating systems. But something was lacking in my build up, which every coder one day or the other soon realizes, it was expressing how they felt, what they took pride in doing! Not only expressing but sometimes you get to know a special idea, something that you want to share, but with whom? So this one is just the outcome of that. 

## About me
I am from India, graduated from IIT Kanpur after clearing JEE. The journey till now ... well, I can say was just amazing! I hope you really find something interesting or useful in here. In case, please feel free to comment!
