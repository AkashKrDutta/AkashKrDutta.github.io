## Third Year Summers Intern Interview Experience
I just had my interview at Tower Research Capital and the memories are fresh. This post might help someone in future or help me reminiscence. 

## The Countdown
We all were anxiously waiting  for the companies to be appearing in the Internship Portal. The companies came in a group. Tower, Samsung Korea, DE Shaw, Goldman Sachs, and many other big companies booked for day 1. We started reading their proforma, and researched about each company, who knew, what we had stored in our fate. So lets begin! In this post, we talk only about Tower. Fasten your seat belts guys :)

## Branches Open For
Tower Research Capital was open for CSE, MnC, and EE. Condolences for people other than these branches, but you have many other cool companies to apply! Plenty of choices indeed!

## The Preparation
After the display of company proforma, in between, one gets a lot of time to prepare for their choice of companies. I contacted my seniors. Had talks with people from previous batches who were Interning at Tower, and asked them about their experience. They all had one answer. The question that they ask at their interviews, cannot be prepared for. The questions have novelty and can’t be found on google. I hence started preparing for other interviews and coding tests that I had to clear (Tower doesn’t have a coding test round, only interview shortlisting. For others, they might shortlist for a coding/quant test and then on the basis of this result, students are shortlisted for interview rounds)

## The Shortlisting
The shortlisting CPI criterion for Tower Research was not something high as 9.5. Many have a misconception about this. It was 8.0. But, they also look at your key projects and work experience. <br/>
My View: What I feel is that they look at competitive programming, what contests you have participated, achievements in them. Also, if not that, they look at decent coding skills. Plus on top of that, if you have with yourself some cool development projects, that is a huge bonus. That was pretty much what my resume looked like. Some programming contests, good development work experience. One more thing, a resume should be designed in a way that shows one’s curiosity to learn something new, representing one as busy doing things throughout the year, and must be intriguing. 8 were shortlisted for the interview.



## Interview Process
They mentioned in their proforma, a technical round of 45 mins. Which, to my advantage, didn’t occur. I had 2 hours of interview with the people at Tower Research. The interview for Tower is held Phonic. People who get nervous in a face to face round may calm down.

## First Round
My first round was based on mathematics. It was a 1-hour phonic interview. Topics asked covered  Probability (not that is taught in MSO 201, but more inclined towards finding Expectation Values), Recursive formulation of solutions in Maths, hard counting problems, a little Number Theory and finally some Algorithm related stuff.
The questions that were asked were (tried my best maintaining the ordering of the questions as they were asked):
1. Prove that consecutive fibonacci numbers are always co-prime.
2. 4 Foxes and 7 Hounds enter a cave in a straight line following a random ordering, find the expected no of foxes that are immediately followed by a Hound.
3. Find the number of binary strings of length n, that have at most k consecutive length of 1’s in them.
4. Find the probability that two consecutive heads doesn’t appear in n consecutive throws of an unbiased coin.
5. Given two random x and y values from 0 to 1 inclusive, give a process to find a point in a 2-D plane inside a circle, centered at the origin with each point being equally likely.
6. Given a rooted tree, find the points that have k distance between them.

## Second Round
This was an algorithmic round. It was also for 1-hour and phonic. The questions asked were: 
1. A very long question about a dynamic Data Structure that required some special operations of a query and incrementing a certain counter variable on a daily basis from millions of user across the globe. Our task was to formulate Data Structure and algorithm for this job. The query gave the number of counter increments in the rolling window of the last second.
2. Given n pairs of numbers (x,y). We needed to form a binary tree, in which each node had values (x,y) such that x values formed a min Heap, while y values formed a BST.

After that, we had discussions about my projects and areas that interest me. The person at second round was better to talk with than the first one. I was able to convince him a lot better.
 
## Results
The results came on the night of the 1st day of interviews. Four people were selected in Tower. And bang on, I was there! I also got selected in Samsung, South Korea as well. But I chose Tower over that!

Edit info : It takes time to reach to the solution. What they observe is the approach you take in solving and how innovative can you become in solving the problem. Once you solve some of the good problems, you are almost there.

Thanks for reading. All the best :)

That’s all folks!
