title: Poisson Equation Solver in CUDA
tag: project
description: Its summer time! And so, it was a learning climb-Parallel programming revisited!
---
The Summer Project can say was the application of what learned in the ACA project, a step ahead of intensive coding for the CPU in CUDA based architecture. The same group as of ACA tackled the project under Professor Mahendra Verma. <!--more--> The project topic was to create a multi-grid solver for the Poisson's equation. The parallel regime was used to get the 3 dimension grid of unknown values in a Jacobian iterator method (physics stuff).<br>The project was very important, as it made things clear about parallel programming and erased much of the doubts that had crept in the previous project.<br>
