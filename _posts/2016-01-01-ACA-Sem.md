title: CUDA Project N-Body Simulation
tag: project
description: My first project on parallel programming, learn more.
---
ACA(Association for Computer Activities) offers Computer Science students in their 2nd sem a group project. The topic that I got was(my first preference) "Learn parallel programming and make a face recognition app based on it". The project utilized the tremendous power of parallel programming in boosting the speed of such apps which of course would be a failure in serial code.

We practiced our way through the sem, working in udactiy, but we were short of time: to learn was too much and application designing would have pulled a lot of time. With discussion with our mentors, we decided to work on the new topic to create an "N-Body Simulator" which uses open AC too.<br>For those who don't know what's an N-Body Simulation, google it up because it's very interesting !<br>
The project was a successful one, we got well acquainted the working of GPU hardware and the parallel programming regime.<br>
Feel free to contact me for any update.<br>
Here is the GitHub link for the project<br>
