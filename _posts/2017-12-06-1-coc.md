All clash of clan players can relate to this. How much important it is to have good non 3 starrable base in th9 and onwards.
Please read the post bottom up in case you wanna find out how I changed my bases in due course of time.

## Update Feb 21, 2018

As of now I have quite liked this base. Though taken from another blog article, I don't remember the link so I clearly state here, this base is by no way my creativity. Fully copied, it works flawlessly. I have even saved bowlers attack on this base from th10s. Happy Clashing!

## Original Post

In one of the wars I observed this base present in the enemy war clan, which was not 3 starred to the last after 5-6 attempts from various ranked players. I copied it but modified it in various places and ofcourse I had to make the traps postitioning myself. I may edit this post in future in case I notice any weak spots in it but for now it works awesome!

This base is an all round base and you will see that 3 starring it is _very_ difficult. In the current wars, if I am ranked 12 in my war list, those who have rank of 4 or 5 clear my base only after vain attempts of previous high rank attackers, which creates a lot of difference in the war! You take one precious attack of a top player! Moreover if you are already in the top ranks of your clan, then rest assured no one can 3 star it (not that easily at all!) :-)

Here is the image of the base:

About the skeleton troops they are air focussed and the xbows they are also air oriented (anti lavaloon).
The best cc troop combination for war is: 1 witch, 1 baby dragon, 1 wiz and 4 archers.

See yourself for this base! In case you find any weakness please let me know in the comments! Keep in mind it's not a base for trophy pushing at all as evident from the placing of th and resources.

Happy clashing!
