**Hi!**

First of all, thanks for considering your time worthy for my introduction! I am Akash Kumar Dutta, a third year undergraduate from IIT Kanpur. So many things to say about myself, but well, I am total blank writing things right now!<br>

**Why this site?**

Well, I didn't want to write about myself in the first place. I love to do <code>competitive programming</code>, <code>game dev</code>, <code>parallel programming</code>,<code>web dev</code> and inquisitive about <code>Databases and distributed systems</code>. But something was lacking in my build up, which every coder one day or the other soon realizes, it was expressing how they felt, what they took pride in doing! Not only expressing but sometimes you get to know a special idea, something that you want to share, but with whom? So this one is just the outcome of that. If you are reading this, thanks a lot, mate!<br>

**What to look for?**

If you are interested in my blogs, want any help regarding the topics, or want to discuss the out-of-box topics, I am forever ready to help you in the discussion. Moreover, I will try my best to keep this updated so that you get to know things better about me and my doings.
Disclaimer- I really like anime, gaming, and so many things! So this site isn't only going to have coding related blogs!<br>

**What you can do?**

Well, you can discuss the posts in the Disqus threads, if you are interested, or contact me if any kind of help needed. I got my inspiration reading blogs of my seniors, so if you don't have your one and like to share your thoughts, this is the place!<br>

**About me finally...**

Not letting emotions run over, I am from Tatanagar, Jamshedpur. I had my education from Jamshedpur Public School and landed up at IIT Kanpur after clearing JEE. (THE exam in India (sarcasm meant :P) ). The journey till now ... well, I can say was just amazing! I'll let you know about the journey till now in one of the blogs soon enough, so you get to know about what is the life of an engineer :P and the trolled life of an IITian. Let's hope you really find something interesting or useful in here. In case, please feel free to comment!
